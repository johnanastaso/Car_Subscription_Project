# Car_Subscription_Project
 Data analytics project about the greek car subscription market

 The contributors of this project are Giannis Anastasopoulos and Nikos Petrou.

 Our work was the final project for our graduation from the Big Blue Data Analytics bootcamp we attended (10/23 - 02/24).

 The tools that we used are:
 
 1) Python (Webscraping, data cleaning, EDA, visualizations)
 2) Power Bi (Interactive dashboards, car searching tool)


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Overview:

 The car subscription market is growing rapidly in the car leasing environment the last few years.
 This project compares the cars that four companies provide (three Greek and one German).
 The data were obtained with webscraping from each one of the companies' websites. The libraries that we used were Selenium and Beautiful Soup.
 After we developed the scraping code, we had to clean the data and unify all four dataframes together. We used mainly Pandas here.
 Finally, we imported the clean xls file in Power Bi and created an interactive dashboard and a dynamic car searching tool to enable users to search easily for the car they want with they want using filters.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Project Outcome:

 We managed to scrape data from four websites, to clean and trasform it so that we can gather insights. Now through our Power Bi dashboard we can compare the cars each company offers and find the vehicle we want through the car searching tool we created.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Next steps:

 The next steps revolve around adding more companies for the European market to create a European car searching tool as well. Also the scripting code can be improved (more lightweight to avoid extra cleaning).

 Thank you for getting this far! Hope you find it interesting, maybe it will even help you choose your next car!

 We presented this project in a live stream and the video is on youtube (in Greek): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrF2D1klO0Y&t=486s
